## Usage

In the form view, just use the following code :
```php
@include('lucbu-laravelcaptcha::captcha')
```
and add an input with name="captcha" for inserting the captcha.

You can validate the fields that has to be fulfill with captcha with the rule `lucbularavelcaptcha` :
```php
public function rules() {
    return [
        'captcha' => 'required|lucbularavelcaptcha:is_caseSensitive'
    ];
}
```
You can set the parameters is_caseSensitive as 'true' or 'false', the validation will take care or not of matching the case (false by default).

You can generate a captcha in a controller like this :
```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Lucbu\LaravelCaptcha\Services\Captcha;

class ExampleController {
    public function exampleFunction(){
        Captcha::generateCaptcha();
    }
}
```

The function will create the captcha and store into the session variable.

You can also get just the image using the route `lucbu.laravelcaptcha.image` or the sound with the route `lucbu.laravelcaptcha.sound`.

The player used to play the sound is based on HTML5. (`<audio>` tag)
